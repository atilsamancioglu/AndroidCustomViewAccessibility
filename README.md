CustomFanController - Solution Code
===================================

Creates a circular fan control dial that offers multiple selections marked by
numeric indicators: 0 for off, 1 for low, 2 for medium, and 3 for high.

Introduction
------------

The app creates a circular UI element that resembles a physical fan control.
It uses a custom view that extends View to draw a circular fan control dial
with an indicator and text labels for the settings: 0 (off), 1 (low),
2 (medium), and 3 (high). When the user clicks the dial, it moves the
dial indicator to the next selection, and changes the dial's color from
gray to green for selections 1-3 (indicating that the fan power is on).
